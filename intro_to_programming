Introduction to Programming 
Basics - Computer programming can be intimidating at first, but this gentle introduction to the subject will make the learning curve a bit easier to climb. 
Getting Started 
- Strings can have ' ' or " " 
- "str" + "ing" == "string" 
- alert(12) will print out 12 
- alert("Hello World") 
- prompt("What is your name?") 
- "Hi, " + prompt("What is your name?") 
- alert("Hi, " + prompt("What is your name?")) 
Writing your Program 
- myscript.js [must include the .js extension] 
- console.log("Hello World"); // a function that will output information into the console provided by the browser 
- 
Variables 
- var name // most descriptive name possible 
- var name = prompt("What is your name?"); // variables can be declared without var, but - -generally should not be 
- alert("Hi, " + name); 
- console.log("the user's name is " + name); 
Comments 
- // 
- /* */ 
- If anyone, write comments for your future self 
Control Structures - Control structures determine the flow of execution within an application. A conditional statement can fork the execution down several paths or a loop can execute the same code several times until a condition is met. 
- If/ Else 
- if (true) { } 
- if (false) { } // 0, " ", null, undefined 
- if (true) { } else { } 
- if (false) { } else { } 
- Loops 
- while () { } 
- for (int counter = 0; counter < 10; counter++) {} 
- Objects and Arrays - An array is a way of storing multiple items and each item is associated to a number called the index. Each item can be accessed using the index value. Objects are usually associated to meaningful pieces of data which it can hold and manipulate. 
Arrays 
- var myArray = [1, "string", true, null, [false, 1, "string"]] 
- myArray.length 
- myArray[0] 
- for (int counter; counter < myArray.length; counter++) {} 
Objects 
- var me = { 
first_name: "Jim", // numbers, true, false, arrays, objects 
last_name: "Hoskins", 
"Employee Number": 1 
} 
- me.first_name; // or me["first_name"] 
- me.last_name; // or me["last_name"] 
- me["Employee Number"]; 
- var key = "last_name"; 
- console.log(me[key]) // or me["last_name"] 
- me.first_name = "New Name" 
- me["first_name"] = "New Name" 
Functions - A function contains a piece of code that needs to be executed several times from different parts of your application. A function optionally takes in arguments and returns an object or value as a result. 
Functions 
- var myFunction = function () { } // function is a keyword used to define functions in javascript 
- function myfunction () {} 
- var debug = function (message) { } 
- var debug = function (message) {return message;} 
- myFunction(debug("hello")) // passing a function return value to a function
