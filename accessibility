1. Introduction
- mobile-friendly, subtitles, contrast
- accessibility is the right thing to do
- accessibility leads to good practice
- accessibility helps to avoid legal concerns
- use ems instead of px to assist screen zooming
- don't put text in images
- view your site in html only (no css, img, or js) to see how a screen reader might see it
- imgs should have an alt or a caption
- try to provide transcripts for audio and subtitles for video. Youtube offers auto transcription
- your site should not rely on audio to work
- try to make all the functionality on your site keyboard accessible
- don't rotate-hide content too fast

2. Websites
- organize information least detailed to most detailed, moving from broad items like titles to specific things like comparison
- use large clickable areas to assist vision
- use unordered list for navigation
- be very descriptive of your img or the purpose of your img in your alt tags
- give all your block elements descriptive ids
- with css you can give your h1 heading a text-indent: -20000px and then use something else, like and background img url, to take its place as a header logo
- :hover, :focus for a clickable element should be styled the same; because when elements are tabbed, the focus style will take effect
- don't rely on the blue outline on focus, because its not in all browsers
- use large font sizes for things that are very important

3. Web Apps
- tabindex="1" // place in form elements to decide the order they are each tabbed
- use a caption tag for your tables and if necessary, a summary attribute
- give your header cells a scope attribute to indicate if its a col or row header
- don't rely on flash an images to present data
- for attributes should correspond with an id
- make sure your charts can be read by screen readers
