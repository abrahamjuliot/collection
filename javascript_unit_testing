- Behavior Driven Development (BDD) - writing unit test as a guide or outline before writing the application
- https://mochajs.org

- to have Mocha and Chai in your project, type npm install --save-dev mocha chai
- the --save-dev flag means that these tools are just for development
- It’s important that the test directory is specifically named "test" (not "tests" or "Test"), and it has to be located at the same level of your project as the package.json file
- With your test directory in place, you simply run npm test, and Mocha will automatically run every test in the test directory
- A test suite is a block of unit tests that are all closely related; they test the same function or similar parts of our code base
- We introduce a test suite in Mocha using describe()
- Each individual unit test is sometimes called a “spec”
- Mocha makes it natural to write specs by containing them in a function calledit()
- To use Chai's expect method, import Chai at the top of your file: var expect = require('chai').expect
