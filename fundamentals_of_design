1. Typography
- Content is King
- Interpret and communicate the content
- Audience, Tone, Purpose
- If you use multiple fonts, make sure each is unique and distinct from the other
- Text Sizing: Headline (300%), Sub-Head (150%), Nav (100%), Body (100%), Byline (75%)
- Good line letting (line-height) is around 120-10% of the body text size [line-height: 1.2 or 1.5]
- Widow is a single word on a last line of tex and orphan is a single line of taxt in a paragraph; these are a distraction and should be eliminated; at the very least, make sure your headlines are widow free
2. Colors
- Start by selecting a base colorous
- Build scheme around the base color
- Monochromatic, Analogous (hue within 40 degrees from the base), Complementary (colors with the opposite hue or hue 180 degrees from the base), 
- Use color schemes from beautiful photos
- Typography must have a high degree of contrast between it and its background
3. Layout
- Start with a logo
- Navigations should be simple though complex
- Whitespace or padding around elements can increase readability
