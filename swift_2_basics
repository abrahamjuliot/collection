1. An Introduction to Swift Programming
- var str = "Hello, playground" // permanently a string variable
- types are optional (optional typing), but permanent by default (statc typing)
- let LANGUAGE = "Swift" // constant variable
- start with constants and use variables when needed
2. Swift Types
- country + ", " + state + ", " + city // string concatination
- you can only concat strings
- "(country), (state), (city), (222)" // string interpolation
- you can interpolate different variable types together
- String, Int, Float, Double, Bool
- use Double unless you specifically need Float
- let bestPlayer: String = "Michael Jordan"
3. Swift Operators
- Binary Operators: +, -, /, *, %
- number operand types must be the same: you can't divide and int by a float
- Assignment Operator: =
- Comparison Operators: ==, !=, >, =, <=
- multiplication, division, modular are prioritized higher than addition and subtraction
- Unary Operators: ++score, score++, --score, score--, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, !true, !false
