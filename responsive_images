- SVGs work best for images that have large flat areas of color
- In general, JPEGs work best for photographs
- Sending a high resolution image to all devices often results in wasted bandwidth
- Srcset with Picturefill (a polyfill) - a polyfill [use async] allows it to work in all browsers
- A polyfill is a piece of JavaScript that will implement specific features in browsers that don't support those features natively.
- Browsers that support our HTML natively will work as intended, and browsers that don't will use the polyfill
- The scrset attribute allows us to specify multiple files for a single image
- When using the srcset attribute, it's up to browser vendors to make the most intelligent choice about which file to deliver.

- test by refreshing in chrome while using dev tools, and make sure to disable cache
- The sizes attribute tells the browser how much space an image should take up in the layout
- example with the sizes attribute:
- Art direction draws attention to the most important part of the image on differing devices
- If we would like to choose the image ourselves, then we should use the picture element

- the picture behaves like an invisible span and therefore does not need css, but the child does
